## What's the Adventure Game?
The Adventure Game is a short game where you choose actions either leading you towards safety or into an abyss of loss. 
This is a game where I've enjoyed creating and what helped me inspired was checking out on youtube by searching "Python Projects" by self taught software engineers and what helped me create this adventure game was referencing a book called: "Al Sweigart, Automate The Boring Stuff With Python Practical Programming For Total Beginners" & "Learn Python the hard way".

Thank you !
